docker run –d –p 5000:5000 –-name registry registry:2

Hence with the –p command, we are mapping the same port number to the 5000 port number on our localhost.
We are just tagging the registry container as “2”, to differentiate it on the Docker host.
The –d option is used to run the container in detached mode. This is so that the container can run in the background

See that the registry container is indeed running
docker ps

Now tag an existing image in order to push it to our private registry
 
docker images (capture image id of ubuntu)
docker tag 99284ca6cea0 localhost:5000/ubunturepo

74f2314a03de refers to the Image ID for the ubuntu image.
localhost:5000 is the location of our private repository.
We are tagging the repository name as ubunturepo in our private repository.

Pushing the ubunturepo image to the private repository hosted at localhost:5000
docker push localhost:5000/ubunturepo

delete ubuntu image and localhost:5000/ubunturepo (if created)
docker rmi ubuntu:latest OR docker rmi <imageID>

pull image from private repo
docker pull localhost:5000/ubunturepo
